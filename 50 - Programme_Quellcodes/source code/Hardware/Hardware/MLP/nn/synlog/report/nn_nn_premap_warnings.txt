@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\yisong\documents\new\mlp\spi.vhd":69:3:69:4|Found inferred clock main|clk_sig_inferred_clock which controls 6055 sequential elements including spi0.write_pending. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
