         Type: OSCH

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The Global Set Reset (GSR) resource has been used to implement a global reset
        of the design. The reset signal used for GSR control is 'GSRnX'.

GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.

Components with disabled GSR Property
-------------------------------------

These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED. The components will not
     respond to the reset signal 'GSRnX' via the GSR component.

Type and number of components of the type:
   DP8KC = 2

Type and instance name of component:
   DP8KC : sort_filter0/window_3x3_0/fifo1/memory_memory_0_0
   DP8KC : sort_filter0/window_3x3_0/fifo0/memory_memory_0_0

Components with synchronous local reset also reset by asynchronous GSR
----------------------------------------------------------------------

These components have the GSR property set to ENABLED and the local reset is
     synchronous. The components will respond to the synchronous local reset and
     to the unrelated asynchronous reset signal 'GSRnX' via the GSR component.

Type and number of components of the type:
   Register = 27

Type and instance name of component:
